Here is a test.


I have tackled many different projects during my time at UC Irvine. [I wrote an analysis paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....163..286B/abstract) of two exoplanet-hosting systems orbiting M dwarfs (cool, red stars). TOI-1696b is an unusually large planet considering the size of its host star, with a few other interesting properties. TOI-2136b is a fascinating planet that is potentially a "cold Haber world," an exotic environment where bacteria survives on a hot ocean planet in an exotic way ([read more here](https://hpf.psu.edu/2022/09/15/toi-2136b/)).
