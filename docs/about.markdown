Hi, my name is Corey Beard and I'm an astrophysicist studying exoplanets at UC Irvine with professor Paul Robertson.

I'm in my 5th year now, and expect to graduate in late 2023. I expect to look for data science jobs outside of academia, in fact, I'm already developing my skills.

I'm a big fan of Dungeons and Dragons and fantasy in general, but I also like to get outdoors and snowboard or wakeboard. Oh, and I play classical guitar.

Physics isn't the only thing that interests me, I study and know about a variety of topics. I studied abroad in Japan, and can speak Japanese conversationally. I have a twin brother who is a lawyer, and I even took an Advance Criminal Procedure class at UC Irvine's law school: that was pretty cool.
